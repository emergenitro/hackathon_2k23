    <p>
        Humans have spent their whole lives exploiting the planet that selflessly gave them shelter. But now, we must pay for our actions. NASA has intercepted a cryptic message from outer space. It's from Aliens. They have threatened to invade Earth, and destroy our civilization as punishment for our wrongdoings.

    <p>
        It is up to us to stop them. We must successfully clear a game the Aliens will be sending us. If we prove our intelligence, they will let us go. If not, this could be the end of our speciesâ€¦

For further information on the crisis, contact us through our communication channels or our live chat. In case you wish to evacuate Earth, or are unsure of what to do, scroll down!
